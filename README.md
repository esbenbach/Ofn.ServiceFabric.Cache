# Ofn.ServiceFabric.Cache

This repository is just a personal playground for creating a distributed cache using service fabric.
I have started from the great work already done by others at SoCreate https://github.com/SoCreate/service-fabric-distributed-cache


## What is it?
A caching service on service fabric with an IDistributedCache .netstandard implementation using said service.

## How to use it?


## Why not just contribute to SoCreate Distributed Cache?

Well there is only really one reason, I stumpled upon the SoCreate distributed cache while doing stuff at work, and found it lacked a few minor things I would like to have, but my initial PR was met with "not atm" (understandably, im not pointing fingers here).

I have struggled with caching before, and figured I could have this as my personal pet hobby project, while also getting stuff done at work. 

Maybe something will come of it, maybe not - but there it is, no good reason what so ever - but who said you needed a good reason :-)
